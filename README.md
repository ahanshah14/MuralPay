Mural Pay


Created two services:
Frontend and Backend.

# Backend
Using FastAPI python for the service and then I used Docker containerization.

# Frontend
I use vite to build the service. I created a very simple front-end for grocery store purchases.

# Service Creation
Follow the readmes in the services to run the service locally.

# Challenges
I was able to get the business organization set up with some fake money but the challenge was creating a client to then purchase it. 
I tested it out from just connecting to the endpoint with the apiKey. Which traditionally I would not have committed but since its a test 
environment and interview I kept in the files. I used cursor as well as integrated with the mcp which was really helpful to get a good starting point. 

More products to come I wanted to create just one user for now but probably would do permissioning (so you don't see admin portal) and properly create a client and test the end2end flow. Fun to integrate with the apis and the organization but still plenty to learn there!
